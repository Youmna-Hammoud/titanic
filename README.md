# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project was completed as part of the **AI Engineers Program** , Machine Learning Basics Course on supervised learning.

## Project Overview

The goal was to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using supervised classification models, demonstrating skills in:

- **Applying supervised classification techniques** — including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors.  
- **Data wrangling and feature engineering** — handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and extracting meaningful features.  
- **Evaluating model performance** — using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices to assess and compare models.  
- **Understanding data bias** — exploring how features like gender and passenger class affect model predictions and survival outcomes.
